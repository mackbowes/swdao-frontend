			'Level 5 funds are subject to wide fluctuations in share prices. These aggressive investments may be appropriate for long-term investors with an eye on the future, as their high volatility is likely due largely to the unique trading strategies that these particular funds employ. The risk may seem worth it though since these funds offer high return potential but this comes at great responsibility too as a series of bad trades could ruin the fortune of the fund.',
